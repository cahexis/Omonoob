READ ME PLEASEE

(Sorry for the mess of code and organizing ^^'', a lot off this code was when i was starting out with bigger projects, and somewhat rushed this project.) <br/>
(As of December 4th 2025, I added some comments to hopefully make it easier to understand, the omonoobs share different scripts with the same code, please refer to the first omonoob's script for comments. I do also apologize for the messy code, as this was a rushed project when I still posted on tiktok.)<br/>
Hi! This was a challenge I set for myself to make a bigger project, which ended up rushed. <br/>
This was a silly character I made based on the omochao from the sonic series. <br/>
The files in this repository will show the scripts used for this one, if you would like to see the models and whatnot, check out the rbxl file!!  <br/>
(name).client.lua = local script  <br/>
(name).server.lua = server script <br/>
(name).lua = module script <br/>
  <br/>
If you want to use this project for anything, just give credit and link back to here.
