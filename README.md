READ ME PLEASEE

Hi! This was a one day challenge to try to create something in less than 24/7, I like to do these sometimes. <br/>
This was a silly character I made based on the omochao from the sonic series. I cut out some parts of the code as I hired one of my friends to voiceact. <br/>
The files in this repository will show the scripts used for this one, if you would like to see the models and whatnot, check out the rbxl file!!  <br/>
(name).client.lua = local script  <br/>
(name).server.lua = server script <br/>
(name).lua = module script <br/>
  <br/>
If you want to use this project for anything, just give credit and link back to here.
